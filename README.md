### Welcome to my projects!

You can chose by websites or mobile applications. Inside each directory represents the country where the project is running.

My name is Guilherme Weissheimer and I graduated in Marketing and with **7 years working as a programmer**, I specialized in the development of web and mobile projects, using mostly JavaScript and PHP technologies together with HTML and CSS to create the most diverse types of projects, Institutional sites, Landing Pages, Content Managers and whatever the client needs.

Today I have in my portfolio projects developed for the **United States**, **France**, **England**, **Portugal**, **Brazil** and until the end of the year **Spain** and **Colombia**. Building in all of them not only the demands related to development, but actively acting in the planning, work methodologies and team coordination, Designers, copywriters and other developers.

In addition to my native language, Portuguese, I am **fluent in English** and have **advanced knowledge of Spanish**. Currently living in Florianópolis, I have lived in the state of São Paulo and had the opportunity to study English at the English College of Management in Dublin.

I work as a service provider, PJ, and make myself available if they need to plan and / or execute web and mobile projects.
