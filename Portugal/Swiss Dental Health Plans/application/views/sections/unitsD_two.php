							<div class="entry-content">
								<p>When Material Design was announced, I was impressed with Google’s efforts to raise their game in the design field. It’s something that Apple had always been ahead. Not anymore. I remember complaining a lot about Android design’s inconsistencies, lack of documentations, unattractive dark theme and overuse of the ambiguous Hamburger menu. Material Design solved a lot of that. It now offers a consistent design language that is lighter, more colorful, backed by solid guidelines that are well-considered.</p>

									Depth is another principle that both platforms share. But they approach the concept differently. iOS promotes blur and gradients while Android gives priority to drop shadows and the concept of paper.

								<p>But while the colors are pretty and the use of cards give a great sense of depth and tactility, I often asked myself, is this really better than Apple’s iOS Design as a lot of designers say it is? I’d like to give some of my thoughts on why I think it’s different, not necessarily better.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>It looks off to have multiple layers</li>
									<li>In both of these design languages, there are weaknesses</li>
									<li>The vibrancy added can be too much.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Similarities to iOS</h3>
								<p>
									Let’s start with the 3 core principles in iOS: <span class="highlited">Clarity, Difference and Depth.</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Clarity</strong> is about text legibility, obvious icons and good contrast. Clarity can also be platform-specific. What’s clear to iOS or Android users highly depend on what they’re familiar with. An icon may be instantly recognizable to iOS users but not to Android users, and vice versa.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Depth</strong> is another principle that both platforms share. But they approach the concept differently. iOS promotes blur and gradients while Android gives priority to drop shadows and the concept of paper.
